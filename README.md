Module 19 Challenge - Supervise Machine Learning

This module imported the lending data file and attempted to predict outcomes of loan approvals.
"Loan status" was a column that was dropped from the dataframe.
Using supervised learning, model scores were predicted in a hypothesis, then evaluated using linear regression and random forest classifier models.
After running both models, it was determined that the training score on the random forest model was higher, but the test score on the linear regression model was higher.
More tests would have to be run using other methods and parameters, such as boosting or using extremely random trees classifiers to see which would be more appropriate for the loan dataset.
